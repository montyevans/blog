> At the beginning of the semester a ceramics class is split into two groups.
> Each one is told they will be graded differently at the end of the term. One group will be judged by the quality of one single pot, while the other group will be judged only by the quantity of pots they produce regardless of their quality.
> Which group produced the best pots?

This quote, in some form or another, comes from [Art & Fear](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Fear-Observations-Rewards-Artmaking/dp/0961454733/ref=as_li_ss_tl), though I had to dig a little to find it.
I've heard it a few times, but never seen it attributued to anyone or anything in particular. Nevertheless, I've always

1. Thought it was fantastic advice.
2. Ignored it completely.

The above two steps are, I suspect, the modal form of consuming advice (at least in my life), which is rather sad. But then, I have no idea who I'd be if I blithley _followed_ the advice around me.
So maybe it's all for the best.

In any case, this blog post is my first pot, inside of which comes a commitment. Whenever I run across an insightful or beautiful (typically they coexist) blog, I feel a strong sense of envy. Robert Heaton and SSC were my first,
but it very much seems "the thing to do" in the tech / tech-adjacent world (I wonder, for the first time, whether this is true in other spheres? Is there an art blogosphere? A accountancy one? A social justice one? I should be more proactive in asking people.)

I have trouble trying any less than all of the desserts on a menu (I also have trouble not sounding formal. What is this writer's voice thing? Do I type away and wait for it to show up?). Similarly, I want my blog to look and be like _all_ of the blogs I admire.
At first (and subsequent) glances, this is a stupid idea. But to push the pot metaphor, what if I tried a series of blog posts, each styled according to one of my favourite blogs? Apparently Michaelangelo spent years copying people he admired (who painted before Michaelangelo?),
and it seems a reasonable and culturally-resonant way to practice. After trying and failing to work out how the Gatsby theme system worked, Lord knows this blog could do with some sprucing up.

(It also tickles my Appleton/Matuschak itch for gardening: different styles of plant in every corner.)

I'll start where I started, with Rob. Check back in a week.

## One Week Later

Several months have passed, and I am in Vietnam, aspiring to write like [this person](http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html), and it finally looks roughly right.
